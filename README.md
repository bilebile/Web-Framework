# Web-Framework
This is a web framework for the development of web applications
This project entirely involves the development of Web framework for the development of web application. The web framework is coupled with a REST API ( Application Programming Interface), a feature that most of the web framework do not contain.
With the current technology, the idea of developing a framework is not new.
Application Programming Interface is the platform to implement functionality that developers can access to perform various tasks. The major use of Application Programming Interface is to express a software component in terms of its operations, input, output and their types.
